My Favorite song at the moment is "Please Forgive Me" by Bryan Adams. It was released in 1993 in his "So Far So Good" album. It was actually the only single and bonus track in that album as well. He has since remastered the song multiple times, but I find the orginal version the best. This song falls into the soft rock/rock category like most of his songs. I highly recommend giving Bryan Adams a listen!
